# functions
- A function can take zero or more arguments.
- the type comes after the variable name.

# functions continued
- when two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type you can
omit the type from all bu the last.
- for example `x int, y int` to `x, y int`
- example 2: `a int, b int, c int, d int` to `a, b, c, d int`
